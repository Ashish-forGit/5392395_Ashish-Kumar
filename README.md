## 🐧 Week 3 – Module 3: *Basic of Linux Commands*

- Practiced using CLI for file and directory management, permissions, and basic process monitoring.
- Understood how to use command options and navigate the Linux filesystem efficiently.
- During this module, I practiced essential Linux commands including navigation commands like `pwd`, `cd`, `ls` (with options like `-l` and `-a`), and file management commands such as `touch`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, and `cat`. I also explored file content preview tools like `head` and `tail`, display and messaging commands like `echo`, `clear`, `whoami`, and `date`, and help utilities like `man`.
- Command history and permission-related commands like `history`, `chmod`, and `chown` were also used. For      searching and system info, I practiced `grep`, `find`, `df`, `du`, and for process management, commands like `top`, `ps`, and `kill` were covered. I wrapped up sessions using `exit` to close terminal environments.

### 📂 Proof of Practice:

Screenshots and command outputs demonstrating hands-on Linux command practice are available in the [Linux](Linux/) folder of this repository.
